| OOP Feature   | JavaScript Support                  | How It Works                              | Modern Syntax            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Encapsulation | ✅ via closures, `#private` fields   | Protect data within objects               | `#field`, `get/set`, `this.name`, `private fields`      |
| Abstraction   | ✅ via methods hiding internal logic | Only expose what’s needed                 | `class`, private methods |
| Inheritance   | ✅ via prototypes and `extends`      | Child objects/classes inherit from parent | `class A extends B`,`Object.create()`, `class`        |
| Polymorphism  | ✅ via method overriding             | Same method name, different behavior      | Overridden methods       |


# prototype
imagine there's a common set of behaviors that all people share. Instead of copying those behaviors to every person, JavaScript says:
“Let’s keep those behaviors in a shared place and let each person borrow from it.”
That shared place is called the prototype.



## super-->>keyword is used to access the parent class in a derived class in JavaScript?
